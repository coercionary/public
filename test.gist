Speaker 1  0:00  
was like a vocal. But it was like those like voices to text and then does a summary of it. So I'm experimenting with that to see if we can just like put the summaries in small improvement. And yeah, so far it's like so if you don't mind I'll just play around with it a little bit. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  0:19  
yeah, no worries.

Speaker 1  0:20  
I want to share it doesn't get shared with anyone. Aside from us, so Okay, cool. Little work in progress. I was told to use AI in my daily work.

Speaker 2  0:31  
Yeah, it's funny because I remember like university, they basically said, this is like not allowed. So a lot of people tried to use like, text to speech or sorry, speech attacks, and like Google Docs or like notes, and then it's like, basically like, you could you get suspended or like, you can get like an academic like suspension for doing that. And now they're like, encouraging and like a friend was telling me like, because he's doing his master's like a lot of people like the professor was able to kind of detect who was using like, chat GPT to do like some other like, abstracts or like summaries, and it's really obvious, like who's doing it and who's not so it works I can get in the workplace, but not like an academic senate.

Speaker 1  1:19  
Yes, sorry. Just logging in. I was talking I was talking with about this with my neighbor yesterday. I went over their house and she's a Political Science. Professor at MIT. And I was like, Okay, well, please like urine. Like, obviously, all your students are very well versed in like this technology. Like, how do you tell the difference? You know, and she's like, I'm not sure it's gonna matter. I don't. I think that that's like just the new way of writing because you know, the city will be able to I guess our pointless people will be able to tell the difference for a long time because for a while, but it's a losing battle. Yeah. Yeah, it's like what did a human write that code or did you actually PT? I don't know. It's pretty good. Does it matter?

Speaker 2  2:03  
Yeah, exactly. Eventually, like the models will get so ahead has given like human kind of like thinking intelligence. Yeah, it'd be hard to detect. Yeah.

Speaker 1  2:13  
Like, you know, you can already like so the students that did that, for example, did you I don't know if you happen to see but almost did this experiment where he had chat GPT rate, his writing, according to the principles of like, some books that he read it allies. So he uploaded all his writing samples and then gave chat GPT the principles of this book and had a grade him on his writing. And it did so they had so it was an interesting experiment, but it made me think like, you could also like give chat GPT all your writing, and then say write this like I would.

Speaker 2  2:50  
That's true. Yeah, if you like train it well enough. I probably could do a lot of things. I haven't tried that, but that'd be pretty cool to do to be honest, like right in the style of Mike. Like rain so style of me.

Unknown Speaker  3:04  
Totally just give me the information.

Speaker 2  3:06  
It's definitely possible that give you like a sample size. I don't know like 1010 of our like, AC posts or like Slack posts than probably be in there that

Speaker 1  3:21  
the only chance that we'll told you about the the thing he made to respond to the recruiter email.

Unknown Speaker  3:27  
Oh, yeah. Can you show me that? No.

Speaker 1  3:32  
It's the like, he told it to right so like, if a email comes into his inbox and gets slightly audits, like recruiter, generated response for that. And he got one from like, the NBA or some company that had a customer or the NBA. And here I'll send this to you because it's so funny and a generated and he told it to like be polite and funny, I think. So like, generates this response, which is a hilarious email response is full of cons about basketball

Speaker 2  4:13  
the recruiter it's probably like, we need you like I think this would entice the recruiter even more like oh, like, you're super interested.

Speaker 1  4:23  
Right? I was, you know, unless this was I was joking with both like, you probably like, did you just answer a message generated by cheapy? Is let's like, Are there any other humans involved in this conversation at all?

Speaker 2  4:35  
Yeah. There's like a meme where someone calls a Pizza Hut. And then on the other line, they like to basically teach food to phones. And a Pizza Hut is calling another Pizza Hut. So basically, like, the pizza is like, what do you want to order? And then the other pizza was like, what what do you want to order and then they just keep going. It's like, just like two robots talking each other like two? Yeah, yeah. Awesome.

Unknown Speaker  5:04  
Because they're not capable of like breaking out of this simple script.

Unknown Speaker  5:07  
So exactly. Yeah, exactly. stuck in a loop. Yeah, yeah. Awesome.

Speaker 1  5:16  
Yeah, it's it's a lot of the auto response is pretty interesting. But like

Unknown Speaker  5:26  
I have a good segue

Speaker 1  5:29  
into goals because on the check in with you, I know we didn't meet last week because like, Is this our new time? I forgot to be Yeah. Yeah, I thought, because we wanted to move it for focus Fridays.

Speaker 2  5:41  
Yeah, exactly. So just gonna be like first thing Monday. So kind of just still follows the cadence of like the weekly started like the end of the or the beginning of the week, and just something else.

Unknown Speaker  5:54  
Sorry, like you accuse not working for some reason. USB security key. Yeah, cool. Let's talk about the goals cuz I know you got them in last week. And

Speaker 1  6:15  
one of them being like, yeah, how are you using all day? I stuff. I think it's a good thing to talk more about. So you put in for the performance stuff.

Speaker 2  6:33  
Yeah, so I just wanted to expand on the testing, but there's no like, kind of the only goal I have. I can't really think of any right now on the spot. But I know like testing and like finishing, like outline that roadmap so similar to kind of like our performance kind of epic, where that was kind of like wills idea. And then you kind of like expanded it into like an actual kind of epic, kind of want to do that with like, not just testing coverage, but like testing in general. Like how could you like library sonar cube a little bit more. It's just kind of like a tool that's there right now that we're not really using at all. It just, we actually aren't using it at all. It was just kind of there as like a check mark. So how can we kind of leverage that or how do we kind of not not only encourage testing, but like use, use those tools to kind of like, see, like, if there's any holes that we need to kind of like, I don't know, like Oh, work on, I would say so. I want to finish like like, roadmap. I think that's like one of my goals, like just finished that roadmap by the end of q2.

Unknown Speaker  7:41  
Yeah. That's great. Cool. Yeah.

Speaker 2  7:46  
Basically, I know we discussed like, measurable milestones. I think that's like a measure of milestones, like just completed that roadmap and then have something presentable. That breaks down like, how I'm taking care of it.

Unknown Speaker  8:00  
Yeah, I think that's a really good idea. Do you want to talk about how to measure it like,

Speaker 1  8:10  
by are just talking about sort of like the sort of talking about what the end result is, you know, like, for example, is this a plan of stuff that we do this year? Is this a plan of stuff that we do until we get to a certain place like you know, is it like time box to the like, feature or functionality box is it you know, like, what is what is that? Or is that more of like? Hey, what I'm trying to get a try to categorize what you're doing. Is it like an execution plan for what we'll do this year? Or is it like a more holistic strategy of like, what we should do and then we figure out what to bite off this year?

Speaker 2  8:58  
Yeah, I think that'd be more of like a holistic strategy. But if I take that approach, like the kind of just never ending in a sense, because it could be like a lot, a lot of things. So that is a good point. It should be probably, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1  9:15  
to two different things that yeah, that holistic strategy, but also like, the supporting and then the supporting plan of what we do this year, and then I can really help I can really help with that. Because you can't just conjure, like, this is how much time we're going to spend, you know, but that's where I could come in and help like, Okay, here's the plan. Here's the things you know, how do we map how would we reasonably like support this direction for the rest of the over the rest of the year?

Speaker 2  9:39  
Yeah, I guess off the top of my mind, I can think of like, something that we can accomplish, like by the end of the year is like, essentially, like beefing up our end to end tests like, and then tests have been kind of like, a topic that we've always had, like, it has to be there, but it provides like, a lot of value, but at the same time, it takes it really long to kind of like run. So I think one of like off the top of my head is just decrease the time it takes to run and kind of make it more like robots, in a sense, because they're flaky, a lot of times like they kind of fail, and then you kind of just like rerun them and that's kind of like something it's not really related to like, how to explain it. It's a kind of like a quick one that we can do this year and it kind of helps. So I think those are the kinds of things I want to kind of like focus on instead of like, like, right 100% test coverage. I think that's like kind of like a holistic view, like, right, tackle everything. I don't know how to explain that. But I see what you're saying. Yeah, have like kind of post kind of like a time box. Kind of measurable milestone for the roadmap, but still like, document all the ideas that we can tackle

Unknown Speaker  11:07  
let's think thinking through that as a few

Unknown Speaker  11:16  
so one thought like

Speaker 1  11:23  
I don't know Sorry, I was debating like getting it. I think this is part of like, the strategy, I guess. But like, yeah, something in that strategy, for example is like there's this like this, this whole thing about the Cypress upgrade, so that we can run. There's some green parallelized testing, right, which should get us like, you know, maybe like 5x reduction in the time it takes to run out stuff like that. So there's been like, there's a kind of a two camps that year about like, what to use for testing. I forgot the other thing that we use,

Unknown Speaker  12:01  
played right. Yeah, play right. Thank

Speaker 1  12:02  
you. Yeah. So like there's so we would have to upgrade the Cypress license. So we did some work like well started something back in the beginning of the year and there was people talking we created a working group for it. So having conversation I mean I feel like that that really like there's sort of unfinished business there. No, I think that that could be definitely accounted for in this plan. So like, I guess what I'm saying what I'm trying to say is like, yeah, that thing got started and never really like had an owner or a home. It could fall it could then be like, hold him to this plan. Like whatever because right like the time it takes to run these tests is a big developer experience factor. All right. So does that piece

Speaker 1  12:55  
yeah, there's also another whole component of this where like, the overlaps to some of like living has interest in like getting a sonar cube going. And she had that sort of as a goal and q1, but didn't get very far with it at all. You know, like some things gotten I talk with her about this, and she wants to take that further. And I think that's fine. I think that's like, complimentary to what you're doing. Like, this is like you're writing this plan. If she's helping to execute or drive one element of it. That's great, but I just want to kind of put that on your radar too.

Speaker 2  13:30  
Yeah. That's not a problem. I can like sync up with her. Like kind of see like, what what she thinks as well and then kind of tackle it together. Because I don't think then Nicole, can like, doesn't have to be an individual, in a sense. Like it's not like, oh, like she has it and only she could choose 100 people or like I haven't hasn't worked together on it. I think yeah, regardless. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1  13:54  
I mean, other people on our team have had shared goals. Yeah, exactly. So like, for example, both like Sean and one had stuff related. To like, getting in sync with like staff and architecture with relation to like, what we were doing the bulk actions back end. So really important that we have like the right buy in for people because it's such a big, you know, significant infrastructure work. So we had to make sure it got was done right. So like, every conversation that one of them had with someone was staffer architecture on that topic, helped them both, you know, the overlap is a really good thing, because, you know, so like, the same here and I think that there's something else too, which is your ability to help Lavina because she needs some help to put together those plans. Like she's not by talking about it. She's just, I think that she knows what I mean. I know that she knows how it can be helpful and can think about what we need to do to get there. But she has a hard time pulling up together and to any kind of like plan. So I think maybe just her you know her working with you are good at organizing plans and thinking about stuff. That's a direct way you could help her as an L to just trying to learn you know how to how to organize a larger

Speaker 2  15:16  
task. You Yeah, that makes sense. I guess it's like something a goal we can kind of check up on like every month, because that is kind of like a not really a broad goal, but it's a goal that kind of needs to like, be documented like it. For example, like like last quarter, I had like the the drag and drop feature that was kind of like, hey, like once once that once the drag and drop feature is complete, or then we can kind of just say like, okay, it's complete, but this is kind of like a bowl where like, I would feel like every maybe like bi weekly or every month you should check up on see like how it progresses because it's cool that on like every quarter but I kind of made like small progress on it and then I kind of just forgot about it. So I kind of wanted to keep up with it like this. Time. Yeah.

Speaker 1  16:08  
Yeah, definitely. I think that us just deciding to talk about it to touch base on it every other week, or even every just make it a standing item. You know, we don't have to get deep into it each time. But yeah, but just keep tracking more closely. That'll help but only if we actually know how we're tracking. Like if we have a vertical thing. Otherwise, we're just talking like how's it going? It's going okay, all right. Good. Talk to you next week, right? We don't. So, like I'm wondering if you should or shouldn't have two things related to testing one is like that strategy and we say this is a two page doc it cut you know it at least flesh out a little bit like what that looks like. I don't know if it's two pages or not. But you know, but we believe flesh that out and maybe even like put more of a program around it say like, you know, you should have an initial draft of this thing by like, the third week of May, you know, and have like a another review by the second week of June. You know, put some milestones in the quarter for

Unknown Speaker  17:16  
it. Okay, yeah, that's good.

Speaker 1  17:20  
And you could do that but just basically a couple checkpoints where like, get my feedback, venous feedback, maybe get other people on the team. And that's kind of like structures to keep it on. Are you on track for that review, are you and then as far as the contents of it go? I think you know, that you know, you you know like the the major areas of testing that we would think about right so.

Unknown Speaker  17:54  
So that could be one and the second thing could be the clan

Speaker 1  18:01  
and that one maybe it's more of like I think this through now like a rest of the Yeah, it's like a h2 testing plan. Right. And we would want to have it in time for the h1 Slash q3 planning, right? Because then I can take that into that conversation and say like, we're gonna have to we want to reserve a bunch of some time. For this work. We need to, you know, I can, I can try that. And if not, we'll take it out of maintenance right now. But I'd like to try to establish it as like its own workstream you know, it maybe that's just whatever it is. Maybe it's maybe it's three points to sprint. I don't know like it's maybe it's five but like something to

Speaker 1  19:06  
put on our product roadmap. This is. So yeah, I don't know if that's just a bunch of thoughts. Is that helpful to you? Do you think when you think about the to that idea for the two of them and putting, you know?

Speaker 2  19:18  
Yeah, yeah, I made a note in the middle. So write that down more. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 1  19:27  
I'll have to let you know when we would want to like review for h2 planning. Like I don't think we need to like so there's the strategy thing, and there's the plan for that. I mean, they really need to be different things. Does that strategy thing? Get into stuff that we wouldn't do this year, like next year? I'm going back and forth on that a little.

Speaker 2  19:55  
Yeah. Yeah, I'm like a different I got it doesn't matter to me.

Speaker 1  20:14  
Yes, make it the same thing. Keep it as one goal. Yeah. Yeah. Strategic h2 strategic testing paths. Yeah. How like, how do we, how do we feature AI and network? Is there ways that you know, are there better ways we can you know, as far as testing goes into the better, you know, can we be generating tests faster? Getting more coverage using the AI tools? Yeah, or just like building an entire developer experience, and like kind of a sustainable way that makes it better over time, these types of things? Cool.

Speaker 1  21:11  
I think it might be worth having a second goal. That's me. It is related to this but it's different. The nature of it is different. And that's still like support Lavina in her panel, a sonar cube. And so like, the idea, the reason is separate is because that's you supporting an L two on the team doing something helping her plan. You know, and you're you're the right person to do it. Because you're one this is good experience for you to get. And, and secondly, like you're working in this context, you're working on the bigger plan, so you can you're good person guidance.

Speaker 2  21:49  
Yeah, I would say that. Sorry. Go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  21:55  
Just say that's a suggestion. You can take it, you know,

Speaker 2  21:57  
yeah. Yeah, I'd say like, I would want to make that goal like once I kind of like have a platform because I think, like right now, I'm not sure what to do. So right through right now, I just know it's like a tool that we should leverage. But I think once I kind of like, have that kind of like, plan of like that I don't have the ideas right now is kind of in my mind. So I don't want to like put that goal down right now. And then kind of get to it and not like use sorting through at all since because it certainly might not be a tool that we need to leverage because it's just kind of like a few if you get what I mean, in a sense.

Speaker 1  22:40  
I hear what you're saying. To clarify, though, it's it's Levinas goal is to figure out how to use this thing is to write a plan for that. And all I'm saying is that you help her with that. Okay, that plan that that plan could be like, Oh, it turns out that yeah, sonar cube is it's a lot of work for not a big return. I doubt that's going to be the case. I think that we're going to be mandated to use it at some point. So like, it's, it's in our interest to get ahead of the curve. That's why I'm asking her to do this. And you're in terms of like your goal, like it's not dependent on the bigger plan or anything. I think all it is is like you raising your hand for her and saying like, I'm working on the bigger testing plan, love to be involved in the conversations around, you know, talk with you about what you're doing sonar cube, and see how I can help with that plan to see you're just you're just in the supporting role entirely by that goal is complete if you meet with her and give her feedback a couple of times during the quarter like that's that's like the minimum of it and then

Unknown Speaker  23:48  
dinner I mean, yeah. Does that make sense?

Speaker 1  23:51  
Yeah, because I think it's nice to like diversify your goals a little bit like until like, that one's purely about supporting team. Yeah, that's just about getting someone on Team feedback, helping helping her grow. Like that's kind of exercising like, it'll get the goals through the lens of the competency matrix. That's a kind of a whole different area that we're talking about the dislike planning and technical vision of how testing should work.

Unknown Speaker  24:18  
Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 1  24:27  
You're going to talk specifically about how those things relate to the competency framework.

Speaker 2  24:38  
I looked at it while I was oh, you're writing the check in q1 Second.

Speaker 2  24:56  
But, yeah, it doesn't matter to me, like in terms of like, looking at it, or if we need to look at our who Yeah. Well,

Speaker 1  25:04  
I mean, I would just say like, the reason I mentioned technical vision, cuz that's what I had written down for like that as like, we marked a few things high. And so I think this testing plan is exactly that like recreating that technical vision. That's you know, that's something that you have self assessed is like the developer developing right as like one on the scale. And I think this is a kind of like, almost like a slam dunk way to move that needle. Yeah, you know, just so that, you know, because you have it, I think that that's, I don't, I don't know so much that you're like, developing as much as you haven't like, had opportunity, like show what you can do. Show Yeah, articulate what your vision is. So, this will be I think the goal is, is right on point because of that.

Unknown Speaker  26:00  
Okay, yeah.

Speaker 1  26:03  
And the other thing that you rated as a one in developing that strengthening was a self development and I think, like working with Lavina, and that sort of like supporting capacity is a really good thing for that too. So I feel like both of the goals that's why I think policies are good goals because they're targeting stuff that you know, we we had marked as the you would assess this like high priority that you wanted to change, you know. Those are the two high goals or lineup and goals.

Speaker 2  26:42  
Competencies. Yep, that makes sense. All right. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  26:51  
So feel good about them, but those two

Speaker 2  26:54  
Yeah, yeah. I'll pay that nose. All right.

Speaker 1  27:07  
It's just looking at a weird time. Just just wanted to have a chat with you about

Speaker 1  27:22  
Yeah, so you just have the the suffer AI related like, personal growth goals.

Speaker 2  27:34  
I wasn't like sure of what for that. Yeah. I saw your like message. So just kind of like, is like kind of on the spot. I couldn't think of something like right now. I feel like that's kind of like something I put there as like it could apply but I'm not sure if like that's like a absolute like, I want to lock that in, in a sense. was like my first thought. I would say, yeah. It's hard.

Speaker 1  28:14  
I mean, you should I recommend working on this and using it. Like, I appreciate the fact that Zapier said you have to do this, because they're reinforcing that we're supposed to take time to learn this stuff. Like it. Yeah, it's important. We have to learn this isn't like, you know, this is like, as are more significant than, like, you know, yes. Seven just came out and JavaScript completely changed. We would like suddenly need to write. So I don't know about that analogy, but you know what I'm trying to say. Yeah, exactly. The like, and so it helps like, my personal growth goal. For me. I don't think it's the best one. But I think it's an example of something you could do if you're not sure. Mine is to, for the next quarter, spend two hours a week learning or, you know, reading learning, experimenting with AI power technologies, and to keep a log of what I do. So I can't just say it's, I have to hold myself accountable and write down every week what I did about it, you know, and I wrote that in my goals so that my manager sees it. So I can't just say, I can't have like, oh, I only logged like three weeks. Over the quarter. I need to log something every week. And the the final part of that goal is at the end, I'm going to do a self assessment like because right now I'm feeling like on a scale of one to 10 How do I understand like, what's happening with AI and the tools and technology? I really feel like for not, I don't feel great about like, by understanding it, like, at the level I would like it to be, you know, and so I want to, I'm gonna see how far I can move that needle in three months by doing two hours a week, you know, and then do a self assessment again, and maybe if I'm feeling like a six or seven, then maybe I just keep doing it and if I am still if I'm feeling like a five, I think I need to do something more drastic. Yeah. Okay. So it's like that's, that's how I'm using that goal to direct me like I have to be accountable and do two hours a week and I have to make time for that. And I have to make the assessment. So like, if I the I just can't get away. I mean, it's I can't get away from it. I'm like, I'm committed I it's gonna, it's gonna it's going to help me in a way that I cannot be distracted from this without basically failing it.

Speaker 2  30:55  
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. But that being said, I would you kind of said, I might want to do like something like a similar goal, but I think more so. Like, at the end of the quarter, I should have like a project similar to similar to like this kind of happy project. So I can like, basically hold myself accountable where every week I'm learning but adding to the project that I want to build at the end of like the quarter doesn't have to really relate to Zapier in general but kind of apply my learnings to it. It's kind of like a hack quarter, I would say. I'm kind of like logging tumors, when you kind of mentioned that a lot of my progress every week. So kind of like adding towards this and like kind of building my knowledge on AI using like open AI or anything, and then I have like this presentable, and it's like, projects that have my learning going.

Speaker 1  31:58  
So what are you saying that the projects just something unrelated?

Speaker 2  32:08  
It's kinda similar to like what you kind of mentioned about the learnings I'd say I think the best way for me to kind of like apply it like the AI skills is kind of like apply to a project instead of just reading about it. Yeah. So that's what I kind of mean. So kind of building towards. I'm not entirely sure. Like, I can't really think of a project off my mind right now.

Speaker 1  32:33  
I see. Yeah, no, that's fine. Like that's, that's just I was just clarifying the project. So it could be an unrelated thing, right? It's like yeah, like Renee did her like travel booking agent thing. Right? Yeah. So that's what that was. That was her way of like, connecting the dots on how these things work, right. So yeah, makes makes tons of sense.

Speaker 1  32:59  
Cool, I, my only suggestion would be to like, think about it. When you when you write the goal. Think about it. A little bit from like that point of view is describing of like, how do you how are you going to be like accountable to it? In it? Yeah. Because doing a project for learning is a very open ended thing. You know? Yeah. Like, it's, it is it's your personal growth goal. So it's whatever you want. But I think given that like we're being provided some space to pursue this stuff. Should like, do what you can to use the goal to help with that. He's just like something you've got it? Yeah, I've got to stay committed. But

Speaker 2  33:51  
yeah, yeah, I can't think of anything like off the top of my head right now. But I understand what you're saying. And yeah,

Speaker 1  34:00  
that could be the heart. I wonder if there's like as a side note, I wonder like if there's so sort of like idea bank for like aI learning projects, like I'm sure there's there's probably some people that have like too many ideas and so many people that aren't sure how to get started with a project, you know? Yeah, Shelton? Shelties. Probably got like 45 project ideas. You know what I mean? Like

Speaker 2  34:27  
I've been in like the fun AI channel since the inception. Yeah. And it's kind of like it peaks and like some some days where there's like, so many, so many ideas. And then some days it's just like kind of quiet. But I think like after that, it's kind of just died down. But yeah, that is a good point. Like, I'm sure there's some sort of like, like what you kind of just mentioned, like, we'll making like an email for like his, there's some sort of like AI that I can use or like kind of learn right now, but I can't really think of anything other than like the hacker project that I kind of did. But it is a good point. Yeah. I can't tell you like a goal that I want to do with AI right now. But it's going to surround it's going to like encompass a kind of what you kind of mentioned spend time learning that technology's good and kind of being accountable for it. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  35:29  
Oh, well,

Speaker 1  35:29  
I think you know, you have a placeholder in there and you're actively working on it. And I mean, that's, I think that that's, that meets the criteria of like what Zapier was expecting, you know, saying everyone have one. See you have it. Now just spent some time working on it. Yeah.

Speaker 1  35:53  
Kind of speaking of that, maybe. I was curious, like, I haven't got a first person I talked to on the team this week. And one of the things I wanted to do with like, feel everybody out around, feel everybody out on our first focus Friday at the end of this week. It's curious like, if you had thoughts about you know, that idea, taking part in it. What would happen this Friday, all those things?

Speaker 2  36:26  
Yeah, I like the idea of it. But for me, I think like we've always always discussed seems like I have the time to do it. But then something comes up but either like a ticket or like, I get pulled into something else, or like I kind of get distracted doing something else. But I want to be more like kind of diligent on saying, Okay, this Friday is like, unrelated to kind of our firm commitment. It's something that we should focus on like personal growth or something like unrelated to, like our sprint in general. So I like how you carved out a time for it, but I don't, I think like the first couple ones, I won't have that mentality yet. If I still in like working on the ticket, I'll probably focus on that ticket. Or focus on something other stuff I think that's your left my my thoughts on it. Yeah,

Speaker 1  37:16  
you're not you're not allowed to do that. Yeah, get America you'll get demerits.

Speaker 2  37:23  
Yeah, I think that's like my kind of like thoughts on it because, like, you kind of mentioned like, it's not like, I don't have time to do it. It's just like, instinctively I'm like, okay, like, it seems like there always is something else to do. And then I maybe like take like maybe, like 30 minutes, or an hour, like a day to kind of like focus on it, but then I kind of like okay, I need to finish like this, as well. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  38:01  
That's my kind of view on it.

Speaker 1  38:04  
Believe me I think it's a realistic attitude. Like and you know, it's not it's not like a binary like it's not a switch you flip. Right? Where it's like, Oh, I couldn't do focus Fridays and now I'm doing them. You know, maybe it's like, overtime you you're able to spend more and more of your day on that. And just start off trying to spend as much of that day as you can. And, you know, just remember that it's like this is a very specific countermeasure to a bad behavior or team has what you just described, something always comes up and feels it's more important. Our ability to compromise like our ability to do the learning work necessary to support the job. is compromised, and a lot of ways not everyone sticks to that the way that they should. And with the changes of recent like it's more important than ever. So that's the that's the motivation behind the whole thing. So like you not be
